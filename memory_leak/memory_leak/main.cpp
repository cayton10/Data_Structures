    //Run in Debug Mode (F5, or click 'Local Windows Debugger' at the top, or go to Debug->Start Debugging)
    //Let the program finish and then check your Output Window (View->Output if you don't have it as a tab next to Error List)
    //It should NOT crash or report any memory leaks if your code is written correctly.
