# Data_Structures

This repository stores files related to my Data Structures class for fall 2020 at Marshall University. 

### Dev Environments

I built most of these assignments on MacOS using Visual Studio Code. The .vscode directory in this repository stores files that were used to build, debug, and run C++ programs using VSCode on Mac.

I also used XCode for the "memory_leak" assignment related to dynamic memory allocation. The reason for this was the need for the "Leaks" tool in XCode instruments. 

### Compiler

All projects were compiled with g++.
