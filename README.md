# Data_Structures

This repository stores files related to my Data Structures class for fall 2020 at Marshall University. 

### Dev Environments

I built most of these assignments on MacOS using Visual Studio Code. The .vscode directory in this repository stores files that were used to build, debug, and run C++ programs using VSCode on Mac. I went through a few different setups for development while compoleting projects for this class. I learned a little about makefiles and how to change project settings through VSCode's .json properties.

I also used XCode for the "memory_leak" assignment related to dynamic memory allocation. The reason for this was the need for the "Leaks" tool in XCode instruments. After completing the memory leak project, I ported the project files associated with the assignement to a Windows machine and tested in Visual Studio. I received the same results. No memory leaks detected. 

### Compiler

All projects were compiled with g++ using c++ 17std
